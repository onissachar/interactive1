	<div id="fixed"><p> She gave us like her recommended list, like everything you’re gonna need on hand for the baby, it was awesome.<span class="g">I feel guilty for all my negative feelings</span>I. You’re entitled to them, trust me you’re entitled to them that’s my strong belief. I think for some personality types it’s a calling. If she caught you at a different day or different month, she might have been more tired and you might have been in a much more positive space. You’re essentially on call every single night Hi pup you’re cute beautiful dog hi you can I pet you?  She ate an entire box once. I feel like she can sniff out the tiniest crumbs very quickly. I wonder what it’s like to smell food for a dog. You gotta get a dog that you can take to work. It’s more like we’re eating to share my misery. He’s an asswipe, I’m not apologizing to him. Mom can i get the paper from the car? I want to draw. No I want some too. Everyone is getting some. No I want it all. Mom Mama I’m drawing donuts. That is so cute. That’s chocolate, that’s banana. So are you paying? Whenever I ask he never says no. I once heard of someone who got fired for writing work emails in bold. Are you serious? God I hope I don’t get fired. You guys aren’t going to New York then? Just LA? I didn’t like the program as much, New York is more underground and you can do more stuff, you can whack and stuff. What’s whacking? Whacking. I’m not good at that. So I looked into it and I was driving the car and basically that means that uh you uh you upped the last session. So there’s this guy, he’s kind of seedy but he’s a fast racer and he lives like five blocks from me. So that’s cool, he’s a pretty nice person. I gotta tell you I miss driving over. So the way the series goes in you gotta re-tune it when you race so you only got 150 horse power and I’m at 130 horse power. I just need to let it go, I don’t need to worry about it, It’s not that I’m worried about hurting myself. They retooled the car and when they put the finishing touches on it and took it out to ride it for the first time the next day, a bolt of lightning hit it. Bye bye you beautiful happy puppy. I want to talk about racial equality. I’m sorry I’m busy. He was asking 100 dollars for the whole bottle. That’s too much in one shot. Yo Cuzzo! Why do the pigeons move their heads like they’re listening to music? [laughs] It does look like that. I think it’s for balance. If there’s a war you get in the bath and put a mattress over you.[laughter] thats what they say, you get in the bath and put a matress on top. Mainstream hip hop perpetuates the drugs, money, crime narrative which affects the way people see us. We support rap artists with a positive message so that they have someone positive to look up to. Porque yo cansaba chico me gusta. She’s so self-involved, I don’t think she’s asked me about my problems for like 2 years. Yeah and then she expects you to deal with all her shit. [laughs] I was traumatized like I didn’t ask to see that. I don't think we should. Come on. It's not me guys I don't think my parents will be okay with it. It's only a block away it's fine. Why don't you think your parents will be okay? It's fine lets go. Can you actually do it? Yeah I’ll show you when we get there. I don’t believe it. We can put money on it. We can go inside now if we sit at the bar. Yeah fine lets just go inside then. He cut it short cause it got to be too dangerous. She said hi briefly but that was pretty much it. <span class="g">Baaby baaaby baaaby</span>, Mama can I go to the baby? Besides having more technology to destroy the mexicans they were also able to. I'm waiting fro my raise man. It just shows how they don't care at all, the just have us there as bodies. Pop! come here pop! can we get that thing? <span class="g">Ben and Jerry</span> are in jail now. I wanna hit it in the worst way, scheming on that ass since the first day. Of course we’re in a place now where we have to have fucking copwatch, <span class="g">Look copwatch!</span> I don’t remember how these attacks on her started, I legitimately don’t remember.  Entonces, ¿qué hacemos? no no no ¿qué hacemos? Why is he talking about whether his daughter wears a bra. Her parents want her to room with her sister next year. There’s loads of things that doctors are doing that we don’t know about. <span class="g">I’ve seen some weird stuff on the internet.</span> He asked if he could ask me a question, and I was like yeah sure we’ve never had any rules against that and he was like does it happen to you that when you go out to restaurants you start sweating a lot. frente sol, perfecto. <span class="g">She got carried away</span> and my lip started bleeding, It was kind of hot. <span class="g">IYou look beautiful</span>, like the girls from the bible. I've never read it. Just look at the pictures. Are you coming? There is going to be a pool, a hot tub and wine. You know you actually sound kinda decent when you’re singing along to something.What you slappin on over there? huh? What you slappin? Gucci. What? Gucci Mane. Oh Gucci Mane yeah right nice. What you slappin? Old shoe, they’re these two young girls but they spit fire. Rappers? Yeah they’re latina or something. How come we don’t see you at the gym anymore? Man I do my pull ups at the park now. Con frijoles. What’s up maaan? You need to get checked. Fine we’re out of here, lets go shocker, <span class="g">let’s go fuck you shocker.</span> Hi can I have a um sorry a super meat nachos. Mommy can I get a taco they have a taco truck down the road. Mommy this is hitting my body. So you want me to carry that too? Three veggie tacos to go please. Let’s see one horchata, one peach. Mommy the bird wants my food. Because I said so, that’s why. Now goo! It’s very testosterorney in here isn’t it? I don’t mind. Ah macho. One carne asada burrito to go. Do you want hot sauce on your burrito? Yeah put a lot on. He is the whitest man I’ve ever seen, you can basically see his organs through his skin. Gol gol gool gool! I think it’d be cheaper if I just it one huge meal a day. Yeah but eating’s fun, I would rather eat 8 small ones. That makes your teeth yellow.  ¿Qué lo más loco que has hecho? Can we get two super carne asada burritos and one regular? Yeah for here. Yo can I bum a cigarette? I’m all out man sorry. I’m trying to wean myself off slowly. Yeah I’m all out today. It’s cool. Of course I’ve been back a f</p>
